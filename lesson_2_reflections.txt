What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder .git is created. This folder contains the necessary files for git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area does not contain all files like the working directory, nor does it contain the commits and history as the repository. Changes made to the 
staging area can be reverted easily.
