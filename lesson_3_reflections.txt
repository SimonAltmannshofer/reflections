1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use a remote repository when working on a project with several people on distributed places.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By pulling manually I can decide which commit and branch to choose.
