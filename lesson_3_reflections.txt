1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use a remote repository when working on a project with several people on distributed places.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By pulling manually I can decide which commit and branch to choose.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: corresponds to clone from GitHub to GitHub
Clone: Copy a repository on my PC
Branch: Create a new parallel version


4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is to work offline on the last remote.


5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without git I would append a version number to files or folders to track different versions. I would be harder to handle the different verions but it would be easier for other persons to start with.
